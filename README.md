## Tempo 

The idea behind this project was to build a social website that forces the user to wait 24 hours after subitting each piece of content for it to go live for
everyone else. This aims to reduce instant gratification and addiction while delivering to your feed only the content that you want.

No weird algorithms, no engagement metrics, no user manipulation.

The frontend is open source and available for everyone to visualize, comment and modify. Please note that this code is **not** of production quality. This is a side project and not much has been put **yet** into security. This means that while registering you should use a completely new password. Thanks for your understanding.
